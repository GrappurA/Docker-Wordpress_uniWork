I can absolutely do that\! You are asking for the full list of patterns under the "Sensitive Credentials and Configuration" section from your open `.gitignore` file.

Here is the requested list in the exact format you provided:

```
# A. SENSITIVE CREDENTIALS AND CONFIGURATION

# 1. WordPress Configuration
# Contains database connection details and secret salts. MUST be ignored.
wp-config.php

# 2. Environment Variables (Docker / Local Development)
# Contains credentials (DB passwords, user info, API keys) used by Docker.
.env
.env.*
docker-compose.override.yml
.editorconfig

# 3. SSL/TLS Keys (CRITICAL)
# Private keys must NEVER be committed to Git.
*.key
*.pem
*.csr
*.crt
*.key
certs/
ssl/
```
